## Welcome to the SEP Jungle Survival Guide!
#### Created by Anthony Chen and John Ruan

We have divided this guideline into four seperate parts:
1. 9th grade content. 
2. 10th grade content. 
3. 11th grade content. 
4. 12th grade content(although this is impossible to get atm).

This guideline is mainly aimed at those looking forward to know more about what SEP does, being **successful** at this class and understand 
the material.
